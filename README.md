QiXML
======
From 12 June 2015, I will start to compile all my XML files into this repository. If you are looking for an XML file that I have authored, this is the place to look. Feel free to use my XML as a guide or reference but please note that not all files are updated to the latest version (this is subject to change). Some of the files included have not been tested, if the XML is right and working with the current map proto, it will be noted. The majority of them are working with their current proto. Some XML files located here will be either fixed by myself or others. Contributions will be either referenced in the XML itself or on Github.
